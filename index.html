      <p>
        At the moment, I am pursuing my fifth semester in Computer Science at
        the Catholic University of Pernambuco.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am fascinated by both business and technology, and I have found in
        this intersection an area that allows me to apply what I love to do:
        Data Analysis.
      </p>
      <p>
        My goal is to delve deeper into this area, developing skills that will
        enable me not only to deeply understand the data but also to transform
        it into actions that drive growth and innovation in companies.

          RideShare Insights: Unveiling the Dynamics of Urban Mobility with Uber
          Data
        </h3>
        <p>
          In this comprehensive project, I analyzed Uber's vast dataset to
          uncover important trends in ride-sharing, how drivers operate, and
          what customers feel about their experiences in various cities. My
          self-study, fueled by data from thousands of rides, was aimed at
          studying these aspects to identify trends and formulate hands-on
          recommendations that could boost Uber's operational efficiency and
          enhance the customer experience.

        <h3>Sustainable Energy Consumption Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          This project underscored the crucial role of data analysis in
          promoting sustainable energy consumption. It was conducted as an
          ambitious self-study initiative, aiming to merge analytical skills
          with a passion for environmental sustainability. By pinpointing
          inefficiencies and predicting the outcomes of various energy
          conservation strategies, this self-directed analysis provided valuable
          insights for policymakers, utility companies, and environmentally
          conscious consumers. The project not only highlighted areas for
          improvement but also demonstrated the power of individual initiative
          in contributing to a more sustainable future.

        In the world of data analysis, it is important to have a mix of strong
        technical skills and good people skills. Below, you will find a list of
        my key abilities. The "Hard Skills" are the specific technical skills I
        use to work with data, like using certain computer programs and
        understanding complex data. The "Soft Skills" are all about how I work
        with others and handle challenges. They show that I can think on my
        feet, work well in a team, and keep learning new things. Together, these
        skills help me solve problems and make smart decisions with data.
